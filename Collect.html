        <p>
          Happy anniversary, my LOVE. This is the perfect time to revisit our memories about good times we had together.<br>
          I still reminisce the day when I first saw you, the moment when our eyes met and the world stopped and our love is still the same after so many years.<br>
          we still want to love and we still miss each other as it was back then.. even after a fight, we make up and become more and more in love. we still have these long talks and never get bored.<br>
          You always make me admire you. I like you just the way you are. I know that nobody is perfect, nor you neither I, but I love every single feature of yours. And if you ever change, I will never stop loving you, because your essence will still be the same for me.<br>
          All I want is to stay with you for the rest of my life. You give me comfort, confidence and inspiration.<br>
          You are the person who understands me without a word. You are the one who makes me laugh even when everything is bad. You have the power to heal my wounds.<br>
          Every time I think about giving up, I think about you and it gives me strength.
          Somehow you motivate me and fill me with inspiration. The amazing feeling of love and gratitude leads me through hardships to happiness. Our happiness. The love you have for me has changed me in so many ways that I am truly different now. You have made me a complete person.
          With you I have learned how to love. Thanks for showing me how great love can be. You’re special to me in every way. With every beat ♪ of my heart, I love you more and more. I love you more than words can show, I think about you more than you could ever know, until forever this will be true, because there is no one I would ever love the way I love you.
          I love every moment spent with you, your love has touched my heart. You’re the rhythm that keeps me steady on the march through life. You are so special to me and I wish we would never part.
          For yesterday’s memories, today’s love and tomorrow’s dreams… I love you.         
          All of me loves all of you. I love you, not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me.         
          I promise that from here on, I will take care of you until the day my breath is taken. I would protect you, from whatever there is out there, I will hold you tight and never let go. I will spend an eternity loving you, caring for you, respecting you, showing you every day that I hold you as high as the stars.
          If time could be frozen I would pause it right here and right now- because my definition of eternal bliss is being stuck in the timelessness of having you in my arms.<br>
          <br>
          AGAIN MY LOVE, HAPPY 12 Months of love to us<br>
          I LOVE YOU SO MUCH&#128573
